### TASKS

# 1: Define a Function

I want you to define a function called sum, which takes two numbers, a and b, and returns the sum

# 2: Test

What happens if you put two strings in there? Thats no good. How can we add typing to specify that a and b should be integers

# 3: Test

What happens now if we put strings in there? Whata do you think the purpose of the type hinting we added before was?

# 4: User Feedback:

How can we provide the user with an error message if a and b are not numbers?

# 5: More extensions:

How can we specify that the sum returned should be an integer?
